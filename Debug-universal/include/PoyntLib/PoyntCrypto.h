//1) iOS generates a pairing code (servers as diff functionlaity as old pairing code) and RSA key pair
//2) iOS  sends public key and pairing code to android and at the same time, display the n-digit (maybe 4-6) pairing code to the user
//3) on android, we will ask tell them that TheAppName wants to pair, please confirm the pairing code to be the same as the one on iOS if they wanna pair
//4) if yes, android generates a secret ( secret is the same as our old pairing code but much longer) and uses the public key to encrypt this secret
//5) send it back to ios
//6) ios decrypt and save the secret
//7) rest is the same as before (sign requests with the secret)
